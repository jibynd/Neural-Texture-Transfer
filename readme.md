Neural texture transfer is a technique primarily designed to integrate the texture of one image into another. It is heavily inspired by the paper “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” , which highlights an algorithm that demonstrates the power of backpropagation in optimization. Below is the corresponding computation graph
